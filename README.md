# savings_calculator

As i do uber eats part time to pay my bills, I created this app to assist me with some features:
- To know my tax rate per year for an annual income depending on New Zealand's tax rates.
- To know the amount of tax in dollars I would pay for a certain income annually and/or weekly.
- By mentioning some random static expenses of living per week, I can know my savings per week, with varying conditions like income per week and tax for that week(Have to mention my predicted annual income to determine tax rate).
